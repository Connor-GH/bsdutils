## bsdutils

This project is GNU coreutils-like collection of utilities from the
FreeBSD source code. The intent is to offer a BSD-licensed and
lightweight replacement for the GNU coreutils project.

The project began in October 2017 and initially ported code from the
OpenBSD source tree.  In an effort to gain more featureful BSD
commands and to work with dotfiles for users on MacOS X systems, the
project moved to porting from FreeBSD in April 2021.


Importing A New Release Of FreeBSD
----------------------------------

When a new release of FreeBSD is made, the import-src.sh script should
be used to update the source tree.  First edit upstream.conf and then
run the import-src.sh script.  The script will fetch the new release
source and copy in the source for the commands we have.  Any patches
in patches/ will be applied.  These may need updating between
releases, so keep that in mind.  The workflow is basically:

1) Change VER in upstream.conf

2) Verify URL in upstream.conf works (FreeBSD may move things around).

3) Run ./import-src.sh.  It is adviseable to capture stdout and stderr
to see what patches fail to apply.  Any that fail, you want to
manually fix and then run import-src.sh again to get a clean import of
the version you are updating to.

4) Now build all the commands and fix any new build errors.

Once this is clean, you can commit the import of the new version of
FreeBSD code.  The import-src.sh and patches step is meant to make it
more clear what changes I apply to FreeBSD code from release to
release and also if any external projects want to use these patches
and the FreeBSD source directly.
