## bsdutils

This project is GNU coreutils-like collection of utilities from the
FreeBSD source code. The intent is to offer a BSD-licensed and
lightweight replacement for the GNU coreutils project.

The project began in October 2017 and initially ported code from the
OpenBSD source tree.  In an effort to gain more featureful BSD
commands and to work with dotfiles for users on MacOS X systems, the
project moved to porting from FreeBSD in April 2021.
