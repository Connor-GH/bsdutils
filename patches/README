Patches for source files imported from OpenBSD.  The structure of this
directory mirrors the parent directory.  Filenames are of the format:

    FILENAME.patch

For example 'devname.c.patch'.  If a patch exists here, it is applied.
Order can't matter because import-src.sh just applies them all.

To add a patch, manually create it using diff(1) and make sure it can
apply using 'patch -p0'.  For example:

    cd src/arch/
    cp -p arch.c arch.c.orig
    # edit arch.c
    mkdir -p ../../patches/src/arch
    diff -u arch.c.orig arch.c > ../../patches/src/arch/arch.c.patch

NOTE: All patches are applied *after* common edits to source files are
done by import-src.sh.  Be sure to look at that script first if you
need clarification on what fits that category.
