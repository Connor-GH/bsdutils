# Historically, commerical Unix systems derived from AT&T System V
# would provide software that originated at the University of
# California Berkeley in the /usr/ucb directory.  Some systems used
# /usr/bsd.  This package uses the /usr/ucb directory as the bindir as
# that's how older Unix systems did it.
