- The following programs in coreutils are not found in the FreeBSD source tree:

      b2sum
      base32
      base64
      chcon
      link
      md5sum
      numfmt
      ptx
      runcon
      sha1sum
      sha224sum
      sha256sum
      sha384sum
      sha512sum
      shred
      shuf
      sum
      unlink

- Maybe incorporate diffutils in to the tree (diff, diff3, sdiff).

- awk?

- sed?

- patch?

- Update import-src.sh to be able to import new versions and overlay them
  in the source tree so the tree can try to keep up with upstream.
  - Move this script to utils/
  - Add Makefile targets for it
  - Move upstream.conf settings in to the Makefile
