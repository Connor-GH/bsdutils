- The following programs in coreutils are not found in the FreeBSD source tree:

      b2sum
      base32
      base64
      chcon
      link
      md5sum
      numfmt
      ptx
      runcon
      sha1sum
      sha224sum
      sha256sum
      sha384sum
      sha512sum
      shred
      shuf
      sum
      unlink

- Maybe incorporate diffutils in to the tree (diff, diff3, sdiff).

- awk?

- patch?

- Use libacl to implement the preserve ACL stuff in cp & mv and other
  programs that have ACL support on FreeBSD
